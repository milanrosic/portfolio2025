                <h1>Milan Rosic</h1>
                <p style="font-size: 18px;">My name is Milan Rosic, and I am originally from San Francisco, California. I come from a Serbian family, and my heritage has played a significant role in shaping who I am. </p style="font-size: 18px;">
                <p style="font-size: 18px;">As the son of an aeronautical engineer, I was constantly surrounded by planes and spent a lot of time visiting engine shop floors. This early exposure to engineering sparked my fascination with how things are designed and built, ultimately leading me to pursue a career in mechanical engineering.</p style="font-size: 18px;">
                <p style="font-size: 18px;">I earned my bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Massachusetts Lowell, where I also played Division 1 soccer. Currently, I am pursuing my masterâ€™s degree in mechanical engineering with a concentration in aerospace engineering at UC Berkeley, and I am set to graduate in May 2025. Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have worked on a variety of engineering projects that range from hands-on manufacturing to computational simulations.</p style="font-size: 18px;">
                <p style="font-size: 18px;">As I approach graduation, I am actively looking for full-time mechanical engineering roles where I can apply my skills and continue learning. Feel free to explore my experience and projects... I'm excited to share my work!</p style="font-size: 18px;">
