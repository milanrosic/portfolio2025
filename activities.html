            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Soccer</h2>

                    <p style="font-size: 18px;">Soccer has been a huge part of my life for as long as I can remember. Growing up, I played in various top-level academies across Northern California, constantly pushing myself to compete at the highest level. My hard work and dedication eventually led to an opportunity to play NCAA Division 1 soccer at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, fulfilling a lifelong dream of competing at the collegiate level.</p style="font-size: 18px;">
                    <p style="font-size: 18px;">During my freshman year, I was fortunate enough to take my soccer journey overseas, moving to Poreč, Croatia, to play in the Croatian second division. This experience was not only a great opportunity to develop as a player but also gave me a firsthand look at the dedication and professionalism required to compete in Europe. Throughout my career, I’ve had the chance to play for several semi-professional teams, continuing to challenge myself and grow both on and off the field.</p style="font-size: 18px;">
                    <p style="font-size: 18px;">Soccer has given me so many incredible experiences, valuable life lessons, and lifelong friendships. It has taught me discipline, teamwork, resilience, and the ability to perform under pressure—qualities that I carry with me in every aspect of my life. Now that my competitive soccer career has come to an end, I still love playing pickup games whenever I get the chance. The game will always be a part of me, and I’ll always find joy in playing, whether it’s on a field, a court, or even just kicking a ball around with friends.</p style="font-size: 18px;">

                    <p style="font-size: 18px;">Travel has always been a passion of mine. Thanks to my family's stand-by tickets, I’ve had the opportunity to visit many places, often with little certainty about whether I’d even make it onto a flight. The thrill of last-minute travel, not knowing exactly where I might end up, has made every trip an adventure. It has also taught me patience and the importance of always having backup plans—options A through Z.</p style="font-size: 18px;">
                    <p style="font-size: 18px;">One of my favorite things about traveling is experiencing new cultures and seeing the world from different perspectives. Every country I visit introduces me to unique traditions, incredible people, and unforgettable experiences. There’s nothing quite like stepping into an unfamiliar place and immersing myself in its history, food, and way of life.</p style="font-size: 18px;">
                    <p style="font-size: 18px;">Beyond just visiting new places, I have a lifelong goal of earning my private pilot’s license and one day flying around the world in a small plane. Hopefully, that plane will even be one that I built myself! The idea of combining my love for aviation and travel is something that keeps me motivated, and I can’t wait to turn that dream into a reality.</p style="font-size: 18px;">
